## 📄 Publications

### **Machine Learning-Based Early Risk Stratification Framework for Chronic Kidney Disease Progression**  
*(2024–2025)* — 🟢 **IEEE ICSFT 2026 (Accepted, Oral Presentation)**  

Proposed a machine learning–based early risk stratification framework for chronic kidney disease progression using comprehensive multi-domain clinical and biochemical data. Integrated demographic attributes, laboratory biomarkers, and longitudinal clinical indicators to model disease progression across CKD stages. Conducted a comparative evaluation of multiple ML models to support early identification of high-risk patients and enable clinically actionable, data-driven decision support.

### **AI-Enhanced Prediction of Respiratory Irritation from Biomass Combustion Byproducts**  
*(2024–2025)* — 🟢 **ICCCES 2026 (Accepted)**  

Developed an integrative machine learning pipeline combining **Random Forest** and **LSTM** models to predict respiratory irritation from biomass combustion exposure. Fused environmental metrics (PM2.5, NOx, VOCs) with clinical biomarkers for real-time health risk stratification. Identified **nitrogen oxides** as the most influential predictor, revealing mechanistic links between combustion inefficiency and inflammatory response.

### **Comparative Machine Learning Analysis of Gen Z’s Clothing Consumption Behavior**  
*(2025)* — 🟡 **IEEE ICSFT Bangalore 2026 (Submitted)**  

Conducted a comparative machine learning study to predict sustainable fashion adoption among Gen Z consumers in Bangladesh. Evaluated **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM** using systematic feature engineering and cross-validation. **Gradient Boosting** achieved the best performance (85% accuracy, 75% F1-score, 90% AUC). Applied **SHAP-based explainability** to identify economic affordability and promotional dependency as the most influential behavioral factors, highlighting affordability as a key barrier to adoption.
