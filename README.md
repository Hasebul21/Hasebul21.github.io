### 📄 **Publications**

#### **1. A Language Adaptive Framework for Fine-Grained Review Analysis Using Classical ML vs Transformer-based Architectures**  
*Accepted – ICCCES 2026*

Developed a language-adaptive framework for five-class Bangla sentiment analysis using both classical ML and transformer models. A curated dataset of 26,028 reviews underwent extensive Bangla-specific preprocessing and was evaluated across nine algorithms. Classical models (SVM, Random Forest) achieved top performance (95% accuracy), outperforming transformer architectures like RoBERTa (84%). The framework establishes a reproducible benchmark for Bangla NLP in low-resource environments.

#### **2. AI-Enhanced Prediction of Respiratory Irritation from Biomass Combustion Byproducts**  
*Submitted – ICSFT Bangalore 2026*

Built an integrative ML pipeline combining Random Forest and LSTM to predict respiratory irritation from biomass combustion exposure. Environmental metrics (PM2.5, NOx, VOCs) were fused with clinical biomarkers for real-time health risk stratification. Nitrogen oxides emerged as the most influential predictor, revealing mechanistic links between poor combustion efficiency and inflammation. Random Forest provided interpretability, while LSTM captured temporal exposure patterns.

#### **3. Comparative Machine Learning Analysis of Gen Z’s Sustainable Fashion Adoption in Bangladesh**  
*Preparing for Submission*

Designed a comparative ML framework to model sustainable fashion adoption among Gen Z using five algorithms and structured feature engineering. Gradient Boosting achieved the best results (85% accuracy, 75% F1, 90% AUC), effectively capturing nonlinear behavioral interactions. SHAP analysis highlighted affordability and promotional influence as key adoption drivers, challenging traditional attitude-based assumptions and supporting evidence-driven sustainability planning.
